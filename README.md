# Milestone1

[This](https://github.com/yllz/Milestone1.git) is a project of Linsey.

Requirements:

1. The dataset is drawn from [here](http://blog.yhat.com/static/misc/data/chopstick-effectiveness.csv).

2. Question: Does the chopstick length affect the food pinching effeciency?

3. Null hypothesis: The population means of food pinching effeciency are the same in different chopstick lengths.

	Alternative hypothesis: Not all the population means of food pinching effeciency are the same among different chopstick lengths.

4. I would firstly draw a boxplot to have a visualization about the means and variances in different chopstick length groups. Then I would have a linear model summary to check the null hypothesis.
